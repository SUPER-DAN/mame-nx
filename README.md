# mame-nx

This is based on LANTUS Mame-nx works.  The only change I have made is to allow us to use the R2 and L2 as in his original release, it was only set R1 and L1.  If you were an XBOX 360 competitive Mortal Kombat II player, you got to have this right.  In fact, all buttons are configured to work as it was on PS1/PS2/PS3/XBOX 360 for Mortal Kombat 1, 2 and 3.  All thanks goes to Lantus, this guy is just a master of porting and I just a little modder.  Follow him on Youtube (Modern Vintage Gamer).
